[#core-publisher-subscriber]
== Publisher, Subscriber

Two key concepts, described in swift with protocols, are https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher[*publisher*] and https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber[*subscriber*].

A publisher provides data.
It is described with two associated types: one for Output and one for Failure.
A subscriber requests data.
It is also described with two associated types, one for Input and one for Failure.
When you connect a subscriber to a publisher, both types must match: Output to Input, and Failure to Failure.
You can view this as a series of operations on two types in parallel.

//TODO(heckj) - convert to a diagram
[source]
----
Publisher source       Subscriber
+--------------+      +--------------+
|        <Output> --> <Input>        |
|       <Failure> --> <Failure>      |
+--------------+      +--------------+
----

Operators are classes that adopt the https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher[Publisher protocol], subscribing to one or more Publishers, and sending results to one (or more) Subscribers.

You can create chains of these together, for processing, reacting, and transforming the data provided by a publisher, and requested by the subscriber.

I'm calling these composed sequences **pipelines**.

//TODO(heckj) - convert to a diagram
[source]
----
Publisher source       Operator                          Subscriber
+--------------+      +---------------------------+      +--------------+
|        <Output> --> <Input>      map      <Output> --> <Input>        |
|       <Failure> --> <Failure>  function  <Failure> --> <Failure>      |
+--------------+      +---------------------------+      +--------------+
----


Operators can be used to transform types - both the Output and Failure type.
Operators may also split or duplicate streams, or merge streams together.
Operators must always be aligned by the combination of Output/Failure types.
The compiler will enforce the matching types, so getting it wrong will result in a compiler error (and sometimes a useful _fixit_ snippet.)

A simple pipeline, using Combine, might look like:
[source, swift]
----
let _ = Publishers.somePublisher
    .map { value -> String in
        // do something with the incoming value here
        // and return a string
        return "a string"
    }
    .sink { receivedValue in
        // sink is the subscriber and terminates the pipeline
        print("The end result was \(receivedValue)")
    }
----

When you are viewing a pipeline, or creating one, you can think of it as a sequence of operations linked by the types.
This pattern will come in handy when you start constructing your own pipelines.
With enforced types, there are a number of Combine functions that are created to help with these transformations.

Some operators will may require conformance of an input or failure type.
Other operators may change either or both the failure and output types.
For example, there are a number of operators that have a similar operator prefixed with `try`, which indicates they return an <Error> failure type.

An example of this is <<reference.adoc#reference-map>> and <<reference.adoc#reference-tryMap>>.
The `map` operator allows for any combination of Output and Failure type and passes them through.
`tryMap` accepts any Input, Failure types, and allows any Output type, but will always output an `<Error>` failure type.

In the example of `map`, you define the output type being returned in the closure you're providing to the operator.

To illustrate changing types within a pipeline, here is a short snippet thsat starts with a publisher that generates `<Int>`, `<Never>` and end with a subscription taking `<String>`, `<Never>`.

[#source-with-callouts]
[source, swift]
----
let _ = Publishers.Just(5) <1>
    .map { value -> String in <2>
        switch value {
        case _ where value < 1:
            return "none"
        case _ where value == 1:
            return "one"
        case _ where value == 2:
            return "couple"
        case _ where value == 3:
            return "few"
        case _ where value > 8:
            return "many"
        default:
            return "some"
        }
    }
    .sink { receivedValue in <3>
        print("The end result was \(receivedValue)")
    }
----
<1> creates an `<Int>`, `<Never>` type combination
<2> the `.map()` function takes in an `<Int>`, `<Never>` combination and transforms it into a `<String>`,
<3> receives the `<String>`, `<Never>` combination


[sidebar]
****
When you are creating pipelines in Xcode and don't match the types, the error message from Xcode may include
a helpful _fixit_.
In some cases, such as the example above, the compiler is unable to infer the return types of closure provided to `map` withpout specifying the return type.
Xcode (11 beta 2) displays this as the error message: `Unable to infer complex closure return type; add explicit type to disambiguate`.
****

You can view Combine publishers, operators, and subscribers as having two parallel types that both need to be aligned - one for the functional case and one for the error case.
Designing your pipeline is frequently choosing how to convert one or both of those types and the associated data with it.

Examples of this, and some common tasks, are detailed in the <<patterns.adoc#patterns,section on patterns>>.

[#core-lifecycle]
== Lifecycle of Publishers and Subscribers

The data flow in Combine is driven by, and starts from, the subscriber.
This is how Combine supports the concept of back pressure.

Internally, Combine supports this with the enumeration https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/demand[Demand].
When a subscriber is communicating with a publisher, it requests data based on demand.
This request is what drives calling all the closures up the composed pipeline.

Because subscribers drive the closure execution, it also allows Combine to support cancellation.
Cancellation can be triggered by the subscriber.

This is all enabled by subscribers and publishers communicating in a well defined sequence, or lifecycle.

. When the subscriber is attached to a publisher, it starts with a call to `.subscribe(Subscriber)`.
. The publisher in turn acknowledges the subscription calling `receive(subscription)`.

** After the subscription has been acknowledged, the subscriber requests _N_ values with `request(_ : Demand)`.
** The publisher may then (as it has values) sending _N_ (or fewer) values: `receive(_ : Input)`.
A publisher should never send **more** than the demand requested.
** Also after the subscription has been acknowledged, the subscriber can send a https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/completion[cancellation] with `.cancel()`

. A publisher may optionally send https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/completion[completion]: `receive(completion:)` which is also how errors are propogated.

[#core-publishers]
== Publishers

The publisher is the provider of data.
The https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher[publisher protocol] has a strict contract returning values, or terminating with an explicit completion enumeration.

Combine provides a number of convenience publishers:

//TODO(heckj) - convert to xref to reference sections on these operators
[cols="3*^"]
|===
| <<reference.adoc#reference-empty>>
| <<reference.adoc#reference-fail>>

| <<reference.adoc#reference-optional>>
| <<reference.adoc#reference-sequence>>

| <<reference.adoc#reference-deferred>>
| <<reference.adoc#reference-future>>
| <<reference.adoc#reference-published>>

|===

A number of additional Apple APIs provide publishers as well.
// TODO(heckj): come back and map these to xref's to the reference section when created

A number of other Apple APIs provide publishers as well:

* SwiftUI provides https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/objectbinding[`@ObjectBinding`] which can be used to create a publisher.

* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter[`NoticationCenter`] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter/3329353-publisher[`.publisher`]

* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timer[`Timer`] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter/3329353-publisher[`.publish`] and https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timer/timerpublisher[`Timer.TimerPublisher`]

* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession[`URLSession`] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3329707-datataskpublisher[`dataTaskPublisher`]

* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit[`RealityKit`] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/scene[`.Scene`] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/scene/3254685-publisher[`.publisher()`]

Combine also includes mechanisms to allow you to create your own publishers with `Publishers.Future`. A future is initialized with a closure that eventually resolves to a https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publishers/future/promise[Promise]. This can be used to wrap any existing API (Apple or your own) that provides a completion closure to turn it into a publisher.

[#core-operators]
== Operators

Operators are a convenient name for a number of pre-built functions that are included under Publisher in Apple's reference documentation.
These functions are all meant to be composed into pipelines.
Many will accept  one of more closures from the developer to define the business logic of the operator, while maintaining the adherance to the publisher/subscriber lifecycle.

Some operators support bringing together outputs from different pipelines, or splitting to send to multiple subscribers.
Operators may also have constraints on the types they will operate on.
Operators can also help with error handling and retry logic, buffering and prefetch, controlling timing, and supporting debugging.

[#core-subjects]
== Subjects

Subjects are a special case of publisher that also adhere to the https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subject[`subject`] protocol.
This protocol requires subjects to have a `.send()` method to allow the developer to send specific values to a subscriber (or pipeline).

Subjects can be used to "inject" values into a stream, by calling the subject's `.send()` method.
This is useful for integrating existing imperative code with Combine.

A subject can also broadcast values to multiple subscribers.

There are two built-in subjects with Combine:

The first is <<reference.adoc#reference-currentValueSubject>>.

// TODO(heckj) collapse some of this over to the reference section

* CurrentValue remembers the current value so that when a subscriber is attached, it immediately receives the current value.

It is created and initialized with an initial value.
When a subscriber is connected to it and requests data, the initial value is sent.
Further calls to `.send()` afterwards will then send those values to any subscribers.

The second is <<reference.adoc#reference-passthroughSubject>>.

// TODO(heckj) collapse some of this over to the reference section

* Passthrough doesn't maintain any state - just passes through provided values.

When it is created, only the types are defined.
When a subscriber is connected and requests data, it will not receive any values until a `.send()` call is invoked.
Calls to `.send()` will then send values to any subscribers.

PassthroughSubject is extremely useful when writing tests for pipelines, as sending of any requested data (or a failure) is under the test writer's control using the `.send()` function.

Both CurrentValueSubject and PassthroughSubject are also useful for creating publishers from objects conforming to the https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/bindableobject[`BindableObject`] protocol within SwiftUI.

Subjects is also useful for fanning out values to multiple subscribers.

[#core-subscribers]
== Subscribers

While https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber[`subscriber`] is the protocol used to receive data throughout a pipeline, _the Subscriber_ typically refers to the end of a pipeline.

There are two subscribers built-in to Combine: assign and sink.

Subscribers can support cancellation, which terminates a subscription and shuts down all the stream processing prior to any Completion sent by the publisher.
Both `Assign` and `Sink` conform to the https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/cancellable[cancellable protocol].

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/assign[`assign`] applies values passed down from the publisher to an object defined by a keypath.
The keypath is set when the pipeline is created.
An example of this in swift might look like:

[source, swift]
----
.assign(to: \.isEnabled, on: signupButton)
----

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/sink[`sink`] accepts a closure that receives any resulting values from the publisher.
This allows the developer to terminate a pipeline with their own code.
This subscriber is also extremely helpful when writing unit tests to validate either publishers or pipelines.
An example of this in swift might look like:

[source, swift]
----
.sink { receivedValue in
    print("The end result was \(String(describing: receivedValue))")
}
----

Most other subscribers are part of other Apple frameworks.
For example, nearly every control in SwiftUI can act as a subscriber.
The https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/3278619-onreceive[`.onReceive(publisher)`] function is used on SwiftUI views to act as a subscriber, taking a closure akin to `.sink()` that can manipulate `@State` or `@Bindings` within SwiftUI.

An example of that in swift might look like:

[source, swift]
----
struct MyView : View {

    @State private var currentStatusValue = "ok"
    var body: some View {
        Text("Current status: \(currentStatusValue)")
    }
    .onReceive(MyPublisher.currentStatusPublisher) { newStatus in
        currentStatusValue = newStatus
    }
}
----

For any type of UI object (UIKit, AppKit, or SwiftUI), `.assign` can be used with pipelines to manipulate properties.

[#core-types]
== Swift types and exposing pipelines or subscribers

When you compose pipelines within swift, the chaining is interpretted as nesting generic types to the compiler.
If you expose a pipeline as a publisher, subscriber, or subject the exposed type can be exceptionally complex.

For example, if you created a publisher from a PassthroughSubject such as:

[source, swift]
----
let x = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()
    .flatMap { name in
        return Publishers.Future<String, Error> { promise in
            promise(.success(""))
            }.catch { _ in
                Publishers.Just("No user found")
            }.map { result in
                return "\(result) foo"
        }
}
----

The resulting type would reflect that composition:

[source, swift]
----
Publishers.FlatMap<Publishers.Map<Publishers.Catch<Publishers.Future<String, Error>, Publishers.Just<String>>, String>, PassthroughSubject<String, Never>>
----

When you want to expose the code, all of that composition detail can be very distracting and make your publisher, subject, or subscriber) harder to use.
To clean up that interface, and provide a nice API boundary, the three major protocols all support methods that do type erasure.
This cleans up the exposed type to a simpler generic form.

These three methods are:

* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3241548-erasetoanypublisher[`.eraseToAnyPublisher()`]
* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber/3241649-erasetoanysubscriber[`.eraseToAnySubscriber()`]
* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subject/3241648-erasetoanysubject[`.eraseToAnySubject()`]

If you updated the above code to add .eraseToAnyPublisher() at the end of the pipeline:

[source, swift]
----
let x = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()
    .flatMap { name in
        return Publishers.Future<String, Error> { promise in
            promise(.success(""))
            }.catch { _ in
                Publishers.Just("No user found")
            }.map { result in
                return "\(result) foo"
        }
}.eraseToAnyPublisher()
----

The resulting type would simplify to:

[source, swift]
----
AnyPublisher<String, Never>
----

[#core-threads]
== Pipelines and threads

Combine is not just a single threaded construct.
Combine allows for publishers to specify the scheduler used when either receiving from an upstream publisher (in the case of operators), or when sending to a downstream subscriber.
This is critical when working with a subscriber that updates UI elements, as that should always be called on the main thread.

You may see this in code as an operator, for example:

[source, swift]
----
    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)
----
