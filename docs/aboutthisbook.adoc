**_This is a work in progress._**

The book is being made available at no cost.
The content for this book, including sample code and tests is available on GitHub at https://github.com/heckj/swiftui-notes.

If you want to report a problem (typo, grammar, or technical fault), please https://github.com/heckj/swiftui-notes/issues/new/choose[Open an issue] in GitHub.
If you are so inclined, feel free to fork the project and send me https://github.com/heckj/swiftui-notes/compare?expand=1[pull requests] with updates or corrections.

I am working through how to make it available to the widest audience while also generating a small amount of money to support the creation of this book, from technical authoring and review through copy editing.
